# S3 Multipart Upload Frontend

A Next.js application to test your S3 multipart upload backend with a beautiful UI.

## Features

- âœ¨ Beautiful, modern UI built with Tailwind CSS
- ðŸ“¤ Multipart file upload with progress tracking
- ðŸ”„ Real-time upload status updates
- ðŸ“Š Detailed upload session information
- ðŸŽ¨ Dark mode support
- ðŸ“± Responsive design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure your backend is running on `http://localhost:3001`

### Run the Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

## How It Works

The frontend implements a complete multipart upload flow:

1. **Select a File**: Choose any file to upload
2. **Create Multipart Upload**: Calls `POST /create-multipart` to initialize the upload session
3. **Get Presigned URLs**: Calls `POST /create-presigned-urls` to get upload URLs for each part
4. **Upload Parts**: Uploads file chunks (5MB each) to S3 using presigned URLs
5. **Complete Upload**: Calls `POST /complete-multipart` to finalize the upload

## File Structure

```
